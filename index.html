<h1 class="heading">1946 - The ENIAC</h1>
<p>Taking up more than 1,000 square feet of floor space, using over 18,000 vacuum tubes, and weighing nearly 30 tons, the ENIAC is one of the first computers engineered. The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, ENIAC, was built by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering of the University of Pennsylvania in 1946. The ENIAC was able process and compute at over 1,000 times the speed of preexisting computers due to its reliance of electrical parts rather than mechanical ones. the University described the ENIAC as the "first general-purpose electronic computer", it's main functions including memory and arithmetic. It is believed that the ENIAC had done more calculations in the ten years it was online than all of humanity had done up to that point.</p>

<h1 class="heading">1976 - The Birth of a Tech Giant</h1>
<p>The Apple-1 is one of the first single board computers. Single board computers are computers that run on a single circuit board. SBC's are more common today in the form of Raspberry Pi, but in the earlier days of computer technology there weren't many SBC's around. Steve Wozniak created the Apple-1 in 1976 as an SBC for hobbyists, and sold it with the help of his friend Steve Jobs. Over 50 Apple-1's were sold before the Steves decided to form Apple Inc. They had already sold around 200 Apple-1's when they announced the Apple-2 a year later. The Apple-2 was ready to use computer for normal people. Apple had sold millions within 2 decades of its release. </p>

<h1 class="heading">1984 - The Apple Macintosh</h1>
<p>In January of 1984, Apple announced the Macintosh. The Macintosh was the first personal computer to include a working mouse. Not only did the Macintosh have mouse, but it also included  the applications MacPaint, which used the mouse to create images, and MacWrite, which used the new font styles that the Mac introduced.  The Macintosh was available to the public for $2,500. Steve Jobs said that the Macintosh was mainly marketed to "knowledge workers", or workers that sit at desks in small or medium sized businesses, and for college students, who he says are the knowledge workers of tomorrow.</p>

<h1 class="heading">1990 - The World Wide Web</h1>
<p>English programmer and physicist, Tim Berners-Lee, submitted two proposals in 1989 at CERN in Switzerland for funding for what will end up becoming the World Wide Web. Though neither of his proposals were approved, he continued working on the internet with unofficial support from his boss and his coworker. Lee had completed his prototype of the Web around christmas of 1990. The Web featured servers, HTML, URL's, and the first browser. Lee's browser functioned as a text editor, or a word processor, and reflected his purpose for the internet to work for authors and personal organization. Lee's idea was that as the Web gained popularity, it would grow and deepen from being a simple website to the Web we have today.</p>

<h1 class="heading">1993 - Mosaic Web Browser</h1>
<p>NCSA Mosaic is the web browser credited with popularizing the web. Mosaic was created by Marc Andreesen and Eric Bina in 1992 at the University or Illinois. Marc had the idea to create Mosaic because most websites at the time were only available on UNIX computers, which were quite expensive, and the websites were not user friendly or graphically pleasing. The poor quality of the websites prevented the spread and growth of the web, so Marc and Eric decided to create Mosaic. Mosaic looked better , was cleaner, and easier to use than most websites at the time. Mosaic was innovative in the sense that instead of having a link to an image in the text of the website, it used a new image tag that allowed text and pictures to be displayed on the same page. Mosaic also introduced a new form of hyperlink in which the user could simply click a textual link rather than input numbers to access a linked website.Marc and Eric released Mosaic in january of 1993, and it quickly gained popularity. Originally it was released only to UNIX, where it gained tens of thousands of downloads, but later was released to Mac and Pc, where the website skyrocketed and brought up the World Wide Web with it.</p>
